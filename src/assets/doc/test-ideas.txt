Ideas for website:

- Landing page with background animation
- dark mode toggle? (maybe)
- Hero image profile pop up
- background images for project cards
- cool custom favicon
- Write a short "intro" page instead of a long about section
- implement tactile buttons UI
- interactive graphics and sprites??? (doubt)
- Make the contact section more unique
- Provide video explanations of each project
- add GIFs and screenshots for more visual variety
- idk have some sort of scroll effect when scrolling
