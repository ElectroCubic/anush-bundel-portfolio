Ideas for website:

- landing page with background animation
- dark mode toggle? (maybe)
- hero profile image glow effect
- background images for project cards
- adding a custom favicon
- write a short "intro" page instead of a long about section
- implement clicky buttons UI
- interactive graphics and sprites??? (doubt)
- make the contact section more unique
- provide video explanations of each project
- add GIFs and screenshots for more visual variety
- idk have some sort of scroll effect when scrolling
